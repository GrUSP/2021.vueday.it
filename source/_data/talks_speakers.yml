        talk_description: "The Design-Dev handoff workflow has always been a tricky part of our work: It's never easy to 100% replicate the design with code and it's hard to maintain interface consistency on the long run with a graphic-based design system.
        However, designers and developers have a lot of ideas in common: designers put a lot of effort on interface consistency and developers would like to have a clean infrastructure with reusable components. How about we fill the gap between design and dev and work together in a unified workflow?
        In this talk, we will explore the idea of translating your graphic-based design system to a new code-based system with a better design-dev handoff experience."
